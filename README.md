# Twine-Story-1-Aetherus
When it came to creating Aetherus, I wanted to make an interactive experience for people living day to day, giving insight into the thoughts of a person living in 21st century America, and presenting a microcosm of the view of young adults in the 21st century. But even beyond that, this was just an experience of my own thoughts and struggles, and more a small story about the day to day that I live, and all things I’ve seen and felt in one small package; both good or bad, well that depends on how you see it. I intended the usage of timers to give the story a real breathing living sense, as if you were seeing as each thought or phrase was said to you in the moment instead of being read, and having locked choices that only open up based on certain choices being visited, so in essence, you control the mood of and happiness of the character, and how they’d react to these sorts of events. Using all these thoughts, views and actions, I hope to immerse the player through those thoughts, transform their view to ideas the character might have as their day in the story goes on, and give them the agency they need to either ruin or make the day of the character.
